# VSCode PHPSense

Just another Visual Studio Code extension that adds support for PHP development.

This uses an already available (node PHP parser)[https://glayzzle.com/php-parser/#demo] that powers most of its core functions.

The extension is no way close to daily use. If you are looking for a PHP support extension the best extensions that enable are the ones below:

- PHP IntelliSense by Felix Becker https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-intellisense
- PHP Intellisense - Crane by Hvy Industries https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HvyIndustries.crane
- PHP Intelephense by Ben Mewburn https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client

I use Ben Mewburn's extention on a daily basis. And its pretty fast and has most of the features that you would look for on a daily basis.
